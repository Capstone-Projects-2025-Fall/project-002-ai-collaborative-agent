# Version Control

**Tool Used:** Git & GitHub  

**Purpose:**  
Version control is used to track changes to our project files, collaborate as a team, and maintain a history of updates. It allows us to revert to previous versions and manage contributions from different members efficiently.

**Workflow:**  
- Each team member clones the repository from GitHub.  
- New features or fixes are developed in separate branches.  
- Changes are committed with clear messages and pushed to GitHub.  
- Pull Requests are reviewed and merged into the main branch.  
- GitHub automatically hosts the website via **GitHub Pages** after each merge.

**Benefits:**  
- Keeps project history organized.  
- Prevents code loss or overwriting.  
- Enables easy collaboration and remote work.  
- Provides live project hosting through GitHub Pages.
