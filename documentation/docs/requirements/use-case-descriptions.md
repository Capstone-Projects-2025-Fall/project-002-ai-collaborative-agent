# Use-case descriptions
# Use Case 1 – Create Team & Define Problem
As a student, I want to create a new programming team so that I can collaborate with peers on a project.
A student logs into the Collaborative Agent system.
The student selects the option to create a new team.
The student enters a problem description and team name.
The system generates a unique team code that can be shared.
Other students use the team code to join.
Once enough members join, the team is marked as active, and the project workspace is created.

# Use Case 2 – Allocate Tasks to Members
As a student, I want the agent to distribute coding tasks among my teammates so that the workload is balanced.
A team leader or member specifies the overall project requirements in the system.
The agent analyzes the project and breaks it down into coding# tasks.
The agent suggests task assignments based on skills and availability of members.
Team members receive notifications about their assigned tasks.
Members can accept or request reassignment, and the agent updates accordingly.

# Use Case 3 – Simultaneous Coding Session
As a student, I want to code at the same time as my teammates so that we can build the project collaboratively in real time.
Team members log into the shared project workspace.
Multiple students open the coding editor.
Each member writes or edits code in real time.
The system highlights contributions by different users.
The system automatically syncs changes to ensure everyone sees the updated code.

# Use Case 4 – Peer Review of Code
As a student, I want to review my teammate’s code so that I can provide constructive feedback.
A student submits a block of code for peer review.
The system notifies other team members.
Reviewers open the code and leave comments or suggestions.
The author receives peer feedback in real time.
The system logs reviews for future reference and evaluation.

# Use Case 5 – Agent Provides Real-Time Feedback
As a student, I want the agent to give me instant feedback on my code so that I can correct mistakes early.
A student writes code in the collaborative editor.
The agent scans the code for errors, inefficiencies, and best practices.
The agent highlights issues and suggests improvements.
The student edits their code based on the feedback.
The system re-validates the code to ensure correctness.

# Use Case 6 – Agent Suggests Improvements Based on Peer Review
As a programmer, I want the agent to suggest improvements based on peer review so that I can refine my code more effectively.
Team members complete peer reviews on submitted code.
The agent analyzes the feedback and identifies common themes.
The agent suggests actionable changes (e.g., refactoring, adding comments, optimizing loops).
The programmer reviews the suggestions and decides which ones to apply.
The updated code is re-shared with the team.

# Use Case 7 – Finalize and Submit Project Work
As a team, we want to finalize and submit our project so that we can complete our assignment successfully.
Once all tasks are completed, the agent compiles the project.
The system runs automated checks for completeness and functionality.
The team reviews the final project together.
The agent generates a summary report of contributions and project progress.
The team clicks the “Submit Project” button to finalize.
The system confirms successful submission.
