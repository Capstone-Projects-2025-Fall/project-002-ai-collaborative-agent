## Project Abstract

This project proposes the development of a Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline collaborative software development through AI-powered project management. The extension enables users to create and describe new projects, allowing an intelligent agent to analyze team member profiles, including their skill sets and preferred programming languages, and automatically assign tasks accordingly. By delegating responsibilities based on individual expertise, the system ensures that all team members contribute effectively toward a common objective, each focusing on distinct, specialized components. Acting as a virtual project lead, the AI agent coordinates efforts to prevent overlap, reduce development time, and minimize miscommunication. Additionally, the agent provides real-time coding suggestions and post-completion feedback, enhancing code quality and team productivity throughout the development lifecycle.

## High Level Requirement

The proposed VS Code extension enables students to create teams for specific programming problems, where an AI agent automatically allocates tasks based on each memberâ€™s skills. Team members can code simultaneously, with the agent providing real-time feedback informed by their teammates' work. Additionally, the agent synthesizes team feedback to generate high-level guidance, helping align the group on overall project goals and structure.

## Conceptual Design

The VS Code extension will be built using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, with a user-friendly interface for creating projects, describing goals, and viewing assigned tasks. Users will log in via GitHub, submitting their skills and learning goals, which the AI agent, powered by OpenAI, uses to allocate work intelligently.

Live Share integration will enable real-time collaborative coding, while the agent analyzes commit messages and comment threads to provide context-aware feedback and high-level project guidance. A built-in dashboard, implemented as a popup within VS Code, will display project steps, task assignments, and include a chatbot interface. All project data and user interactions will be stored securely using Supabase.

## Background

As software development becomes increasingly collaborative, the ability to effectively coordinate tasks and share responsibilities among team members is critical, especially for students and early-career programmers learning to work in teams. Traditional project management tools often operate outside the development environment, causing context switching and reducing workflow efficiency. Meanwhile, students frequently face challenges in dividing responsibilities, understanding project scope, and aligning on high-level goals, especially when working remotely.

With the rise of intelligent coding assistants and collaborative tools like GitHub and Live Share, there is a growing opportunity to integrate AI-driven project guidance directly into the development environment. Leveraging these technologies can bridge the gap between learning and doing, helping teams not only write code together but also collaborate strategically, receive real-time feedback, and stay aligned on project objectives.

This project addresses these needs by introducing an AI-enhanced VS Code extension that helps teams create projects, distribute tasks based on skill sets, collaborate in real time, and receive feedback and high-level guidance, all within a single, familiar workspace. By embedding intelligent coordination directly into the development workflow, this tool aims to improve both the learning experience and productivity of collaborative coding teams.

## Required Resources

- Visual Studio Code with extension development tools
- TypeScript, HTML, and CSS for extension UI and logic
- GitHub OAuth for user authentication and profile data
- Visual Studio Live Share for real-time collaborative coding
