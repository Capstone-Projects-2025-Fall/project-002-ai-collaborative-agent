So that every team member knows exactly what to do according to their known skills and the programming languages they can manage. That way, every team member is working towards the same goal but has different specialized responsibilities. The agent takes the role of leadership in helping all the team members work in unison, but without working on the same requirement for the project. This avoids lost time and problems in development, and the Agent is also able to give suggestions on the code each member is working on as well as after the section is complete."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}}}]);
