The agent takes the role of leadership in helping all the team members work in unison, but without working on the same requirement for the project.

However, they are still hindered by poor communication in teams. These programmers will work on the same project and while being efficient programming they waste time with merge conflicts and bugs. This leads to a lot of time wasted, and a lot of issues outside the code itself. Our project is trying to address this by implementing a system that distributes roles to a team and keeps live updates on the code. With this approach we hope that AI coding assistance can be used for more than just improved programming, and can be used for more collaborative projects."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
