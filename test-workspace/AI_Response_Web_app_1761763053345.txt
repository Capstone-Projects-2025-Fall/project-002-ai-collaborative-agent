1. TEAM ANALYSIS: 
The team consists of three members. Thomas Ishida, who appears twice in the team composition (likely due to a data entry error), has strengths in database management and web development. He is comfortable working on both the back-end (with Python and SQL skills) and the front-end (with HTML skills). Natanim Tilahun's skills and programming languages are not specified, which makes it challenging to assign specific tasks.

2. PROJECT FEASIBILITY: 
The project's goal is to create a fully functional web app with a full-stack requirement. Given the team's skills, the project is achievable. However, there might be challenges in areas such as UI/UX design, back-end development (if complex programming beyond Python and SQL is required), and front-end development (if advanced JavaScript frameworks are needed as HTML alone might not suffice for a modern web app).

3. ROLE ASSIGNMENTS: 
Based on the available information, I recommend the following roles:
   - Thomas Ishida (database management): Back-end developer, focusing on database design and management.
   - Thomas Ishida (web dev): Front-end developer, focusing on creating the user interface.
   - Natanim Tilahun: As his skills and programming languages are not specified, he could be assigned tasks after identifying his skills and interests.

4. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS: 
   - Cross-skilling: Encourage team members to learn from each other's skillsets. This not only provides backup if a team member is unavailable but also helps in understanding different aspects of the project.
   - Defining Natanim Tilahun's role: It's essential to understand Natanim's skills and preferences to optimally utilize his potential.
   - Regular communication: Regular team meetings to discuss progress, issues, and feedback can ensure the project stays on track.

5. RISK ASSESSMENT: 
   - Skill gap: The team might struggle if advanced programming skills are required.
   - Unclear roles: Without clear roles, team members might struggle with understanding their responsibilities.
   - Mitigation: Cross-skilling, training, and ensuring clear communication of roles and responsibilities can help mitigate these risks.

6. DELIVERABLES MAPPING: 
   - Requirement Analysis & Design: Understand the project's requirements and prepare the database design and web design.
   - Back-end Development: Implement the database and server-side logic.
   - Front-end Development: Develop the user interface.
   - Testing: Ensure the web application functions as expected and debug any errors.
   - Deployment: Deploy the web application on a server and ensure it's working properly.
