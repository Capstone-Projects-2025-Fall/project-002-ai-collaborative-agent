1. TEAM ANALYSIS: 
   The current team consists of only one member, Thomas Ishida, with a skill set in database management. The major gap in the team is the lack of diversity in both the number of team members and skills. Thomas doesn't mention any programming languages he's proficient in, which could be a significant issue if the project involves coding. Also, the willingness to work on different tasks is not specified, which might limit the flexibility in task allocation.

2. PROJECT FEASIBILITY:
   Given the limited information about the project's specific requirements and goals, it's challenging to accurately assess feasibility. However, if the project is heavily reliant on database management, Thomas's skills might suffice. If the project requires other areas of expertise, such as front-end development, back-end development, or UX/UI design, the current team composition could pose significant challenges.

3. ROLE ASSIGNMENTS:
   Based on the existing data, Thomas Ishida should be assigned as the Database Manager given his mentioned skills. However, he might also need to take on other roles, depending on the project's specific requirements, which is not an ideal scenario due to the potential for skill mismatch and over-allocation.

4. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   The team needs to be expanded to include members with diverse skills. If the project involves programming, hiring experienced developers proficient in the required languages is crucial. Also, having a project manager to oversee the project progression, delegate tasks, and ensure the project stays on track would be beneficial. 

5. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   The primary risk is that the project may stall or fail due to the lack of necessary skills in the team. To mitigate this risk, a thorough skills gap analysis should be conducted, and additional members with the required skills should be recruited. Another risk is overloading Thomas with tasks beyond his skill set, resulting in decreased productivity and potential burnout. This can be mitigated by properly delegating tasks to suitable team members.

6. DELIVERABLES MAPPING:
   Without specific details on the project requirements, it's challenging to break down the project into deliverables. However, as a general approach, the project can be divided into stages such as project setup, database setup and management, development phase (if required), testing phase, and final deployment. Each stage should have clear outputs and deadlines that align with the overall project timeline.
